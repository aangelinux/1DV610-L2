### Bugs
- ~~resetChart() does not always remove last child of the chart element~~
- For some pie slice ratios, the pie doesn't "close" completely, it leaves a tiny gap  
  
### Style issues
- ~~There is a small gap between x-axis and end of y-axis~~
- For pie charts, data object's name and percentage should be written on the slice
- Chart title should be rendered above the chart
- Y-axis values should be rendered to the side of the chart
