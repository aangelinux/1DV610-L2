### Bugs
- resetChart() does not always remove last child of the chart element
- For 1:1:1 pie slice ratios, the pie doesn't "close" completely  
  
### Style issues
- ~~There is a small gap between x-axis and end of y-axis~~
- For pie charts, data object's name and percentage isn't written on the slice
- For line graphs, there should be some space between x-axis and lowest data value
- Chart title should be rendered above the chart
- Y-axis values should be rendered to the side of the chart
